## **Key Insights** 


- **Monthly Revenue Cycle:**  
  Revenue stays stable between ≈\$23M–\$26.5M across 2014–2017, with no consistent seasonal spikes. Sharpest drop (≈\$21.2M) occurs in early 2017, indicating a possible one-time disruption.

- **Channel Mix:**  
  Wholesale: 54%. Distributors: 31%. Exports: 15% — opportunity to scale international presence.

- **Top Products (Revenue):**  
  Product 26: \$118M; Product 25: \$110M; Product 13: \$78M. Mid-tier: \$68–75M; bottom performers: \$52–57M.

- **Profit Margins:**  
  Profit margins range broadly from ≈18% to ≈60%, with no strong correlation to unit price. Dense horizontal bands suggest standardized pricing strategies across tiers.

- **Seasonal Volume:**  
  No strong monthly pattern, but slight volume uptick appears around May–June. Early 2017 dip (≈\$21.2M) may require investigation.

- **Regional Performance:**  
  California leads: ≈\$230M Revenue & 7500+ orders. Illinois/Florida/Texas: ≈\$85M–$110M & ≈3500–4500 orders. NY/Indiana: ≈\$54M & 2000+ orders.
